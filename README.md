I'm developing a repository to implement and evaluate various machine learning models utilizing a medical patents dataset. The dataset consists of 55,500 entries and 15 columns, covering critical patient, hospital, and medical data. This repository will focus on applying techniques for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building tailored to this dataset.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset includes detailed information such as patient demographics, medical history, hospital details, and test results. Key attributes include:

Patient Information: Name, age, gender, and blood type.
Medical Details: Diagnosed conditions, medications prescribed, test results (Normal, Abnormal, Inconclusive), and admission/discharge dates.
Hospital Information: Attending doctor, hospital name, room number, admission type (e.g., Urgent, Emergency, Elective), and billing amount.
Insurance Details: Insurance provider names.
The project aims to build robust machine learning models for predicting outcomes based on test results, addressing classification challenges in healthcare data. The repository will prioritize reproducibility, insightful analysis, and contributions toward improving medical decision-making.
